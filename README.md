# STRING LIBRARY IN C++

Here is my own implementation of the string class in C++. This lightweight library uses a combination of user defind and C standard string library to get job done. Literally 'No strings attached'. 
The following mentions more about the repository and the build process to build the libraries.

## FEATURES

- Overloaded operators such as(>>,<<,=) to facilitate the object operate like a datatype.
- Constructors designed in a way to allow deep copy and take various way of input using paramterized constructor.
- Memory dynamically allocated and freed at the end of the object's life
